## Expectations for you, students

This will be a whole adventure on improving both your soft skills and technical skills. The process is as important (or even more!) as the result.

## DemoDay

Since Covid19 is challenging our flexibility and perseverance, we can't tell just yet whether we'll be able to organise a DemoDay in person or online.
This will be confirmed as soon as possible, mid May the latest.
What we can already tell is the date!
